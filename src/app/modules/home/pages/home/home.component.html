    COCOMO was originally developed by Barry W. Boehm, an american software engineer,
    to assist with procedurally generating software project estimates.

    CPM can be useful during project planning stages of a project to help identify time dependent tasks. This is determined by identifying all
    tasks, their durations, and their approximate location in time (step A precedes step B, etc.) Once these are determined a Early Start, Early
    Finish, Late Start, Late Finish, and Float can be calculated. Steps with a Float of 0 are considered the steps that will determine the overall
    length of the project.
